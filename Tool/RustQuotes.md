# What people say about Rust

> Rust is the first programming language I've encountered in years that makes me excited. And not just normal excited: irrationally excited. Like the kind of excitement you have for something when you are naive about its limitations and don't know any better (like many blockchain/cryptocurrency advocates). I feel like the discovery of Rust is transporting me back to my younger self, before I discovered the ugly realities of how computers and software work, and is giving me hope that better tools, better ways of building software could actually exist. To channel my inner Marie Kondo: Rust sparks joy.
>
> When I started learning Rust in earnest in 2018, I thought this was a fluke. It is just the butterflies you get when you think you fall in love, I told myself. Give it time: your irrational excitement will fade. But after using Rust for ~2.5 years now, my positive feelings about it have only grown stronger.

> Perlism: you'll only learn the language once, you'll use it for the rest of your life.

> Rust is one of only a handful of programming languages that make coding a really enjoyable experience for me: an expressive type system, strong memory-safety guarantees without a GC, high performance, and an awesome community. Whenever I can come up with an excuse to use Rust, I do just that — and this is no different.

> When I am writing C++, I'm thinking about undefined behavior and bugs the compiler won't catch. When I'm writing Rust, I'm thinking instead about how to optimize things or add features. There is a very real cognitive load difference and it makes me more productive.

> Rust is an intriguing language for me. It closely resembles C++ in many ways, hitting all the right notes when it comes to compilation and runtime model, type system and deterministic finalization, that I could not help but get a little excited about this fresh new take on language design. I have spent almost every waking moment over the last few months (that I’m not hanging out with my family) exploring, studying, and experimenting with Rust.
> -- [My Rust adventure begins](https://kennykerr.ca/2019/11/05/rust/)

> The beauty of programming language design is not building the most complex edifice like Scala or making the language unacceptably crippled like Go - but giving the programmer the ability to represent complex ideas elegantly and safely. Rust really shines in that regard.
> -- [My favorite rust function](https://blog.jabid.in/2019/10/11/drop.html)

> Many programming languages start from a specific niche (like R and statistics, or Maple and mathematics) and grow into larger languages over time. While Rust goal is not to be a scientific language, its focus on being a general purpose language allows a phenomenon similar to what happened with Python, where people from many areas pushed the language in different directions (system scripting, web development, numerical programming...) allowing developers to combine all these things in their systems.

> I love the language. And I actually feel like I’m more productive in it than in other languages.

> "I REALLY want to use this for everything, even if it isn't the best tool for the job."

> Discord has never been afraid of embracing new technologies that look promising. For example, we were early adopters of Elixir, React, React Native, and Scylla. If a piece of technology is promising and gives us an advantage, we do not mind dealing with the inherent difficulties and instability of the bleeding edge. This is one of the ways we’ve quickly reached 250+ million users with less than 50 engineers. Embracing the new async features in Rust nightly is another example of our willingness to embrace new, promising technology.

> I've gotten farther than I thought in a short time. That is a testament to Rust. I absolutely could not have done what I've done so far with C++. I still would be debugging core-dumps. The Rust compiler ensures that my code is safe and can't crash. That said, I still fight a lot with the borrow checker. I suspect the problem isn't the language but that I'm using it wrong. After too many years of using garbage collected languages I don't pay enough attention to where and when I allocate resources.

> However, don’t go around and ask other people to rewrite their projects in Rust (don’t be rude) or think that your own rewrite is magically going to be much faster and less buggy than the existing implementation. While Rust saves you from a big class of possible bugs, it doesn’t save you from yourself and usually rewrites contain bugs that didn’t exist in the original implementation. Also getting good performance in Rust requires, like in every other language, some effort. Before rewriting any software, think about the goals of this rewrite realistically as well as the effort required to actually get it finished.

> Sometimes, our goal isn’t really to write perfect code that is performant, correct, handles all kinds of errors sanely, has great UX and is maintainable. These projects are what we are proud of, sure.
> But sometimes we just need to throw something together really fast and don’t care about the quality as much.

> I haven’t been using Rust for production much; maybe a bit more than a year. The static type checks means I’m getting much less bugs in my code, and spend considerably less time in debugging. I can safely say that, for me, Rust is more productive than JavaScript, PHP or Python and the margin keeps getting larger as I get more acquainted with the ecosystem.
> [Rust as a productive high-level language](https://omarabid.com/rust-high-level-language)

> I used to think that the reason I loved both Haskell and Rust so much was their shared strong typing, ADTs, and pattern matching combination.
> After a recent discussion, I think it may be more about being expression-oriented languages.
> [Michael Snoyman](https://twitter.com/snoyberg/status/1348486654017855489)

> Instead of relying on declare-then-assign patterns, both languages allow conditionals and other constructs to evaluate to values. This reduces the frequency of seeing mutable assignment and avoids cases of uninitialized variables. By restricting mutable assignment to cases where it's actual mutation, we get to free up a lot of head space to focus on the trickier parts of programming.
> Since I started using Haskell, I feel strongly hampered using any language without a rich, flexible, and powerful type system. Rust's embrace of Algebraic Data Types (ADTs) feels natural.
> I see both languages embracing the idea that encouraging programmers to define and use strong typing mechanisms leads to better code. And it's a message I wholeheartedly endorse.
> Rust has fully embraced the concepts of using better approaches to solve problems, and to steal great ideas that have been tried and tested. We believe Rust has the potential to drastically improve software quality in the world, and lead to more maintainable solutions.
> As we're engineers who like playing with shiny tools, if someone wants to have extra fun, Rust is usually it.

> I have to say, the Rust bindings to GTK are much more ergonomic than the C/C++/c#. I think there's something in Rust that makes many implementations much more ergonomic than their C counterpart.

> As a long-time C++ programmer, and C++ instructor, I am convinced that Rust is better than C++ in all of C++'s application space, that for any new programming project where C++ would make sense as the programming language, Rust would make more sense.

> Rust is not just a safer alternative to C++, but, as I continue to argue, unsafe Rust is a better unsafe language than C++.

> Rust is the first language that can reliably do everything well.
> When you have 5 different languages... you inevitably implement the same things 5 times. With a single language, you can have a single library of software packages that can be used across all the teams of the organization.
> [Rust is minimalist](https://kerkour.com/rust-is-minimalist)

> So, assuming I’ve convinced you that Rust has a better organized feature-set than C++, we have to discuss what, in the big picture, C++ has done wrong and Rust has done right.
>
> The first and most obvious thing Rust did right was learn from the mistakes of the past. Each new version of C++ has to be compatible with previous versions to a great extent, including (in a lot of ways) C, giving it a legacy back into the early 70’s. Rust started maintaining compatibility in 2015, and so it’s only had 7 years or so of cruft, but knew about all of C++’s later add-ons from the beginning.
>
> And one of the things Rust learned from the experience of others is how to mitigate this effect, so we can hope Rust retains its youthful freshness for longer going forward. Rust has an edition system, so that features actually can be deprecated and phased out, while still maintaining compatibility.
> https://www.thecodedmessage.com/posts/2022-05-11-programming-multiparadigm/

> From now it should be completely understandable why Rust feels like a full of holes from time to time; in fact, it is almost a miracle that it is functioning at all. A computer language is like a system of tightly intertwined components: every time you introduce a new linguistic abstraction, you have to make sure that it plays well with the rest of the system to avoid bugs and inconsistencies.

### 442

Rust limits severity of the damage an inexperienced programmer can cause. Once they manage to get the code to compile, it already has lots of correctness guarantees. “Bad” Rust code may just clone more than strictly necessary, or write 10 lines of code for something that has a helper method in the stdlib, but it won’t corrupt memory or blindly run the happy path without checking for errors.

### 390

> You won’t appreciate Rust unless you spend few weeks building something in it. The initial steep learning curve could be frustrating or challenging depending on how you see it, but once past that it’s hard not to love it.

> [My second impression of Rust and why I think it's the best general-purpose language!](https://deepu.tech/my-second-impression-of-rust/)

### 377

The main theme of Rust is not systems programming, speed, or memory safety - it's moving runtime problems to compile time. Everything else is incidental. This is an invaluable quality of any language, and is something Rust greatly excels at.

### 376

Having a fast language is not enough (ASM), and having a language with strong type guarantees neither (Haskell), and having a language with ease of use and portability also neither (Python/Java). Combine all of them together, and you get the best of all these worlds.

Rust is not the best option for any coding philosophy, it’s the option that is currently the best at combining all these philosophies.

### 373

> Rust favours security over convenience. Rust does not want you to make silly little mistakes than can waste so much of your time debugging, which in the end makes it more convenient.

### 368

> Writing rust for me is a gradual process of the compiler patiently guiding me towards the program I should have written in the first place, and at the end I take all the credit.
>
> – @felixwatts on Discord

### 362

> what many devs often miss initially when talking about Rust is that it isn't just about the design & details of the language (which is great), Rust's super power is that in combination with its fantastic community & ecosystem, and the amazing friendly people that create & form it.

> Empowering is the perfect word to describe Rust in 2020. What used to be a rough adventure with many pitfalls has turned into something beautiful, something that can lift your spirit. At least, that’s what it did for me.

[Mathias Lafeldt on his blog](https://sharpend.io/giving-rust-another-shot-in-2020/)

### 339

> The whole motivation behind exceptions is to allow one to write ones business logic, concentrate on what one likes to think ones program will do, without having lots of fiddly error checking and handling code obscuring that logic. Error situations are therefore swept under the carpet with "try" and kept out of sight with "catch".

> However in my world view failure is not exceptional, it is a common happening, it's too important to be hidden away. Therefor failure handling should be in ones face in the code you write. Certainly in the face of those that read it.

## 288

> I used to think of programs as execution flowing and think about what the CPU is doing. As I moved to rust I started thinking a lot more about memory: how the data was laid out in memory, and how ownership of different parts of memory is given to different parts of the program at run time.

– Oliver Gould on "The Open Source Show: All About Rust

> I always think of borrow checker as an angel sitting on your shoulder, advising you not to sin against the rules of ownership and borrowing, so your design will be obvious and your code simple and fast.

### 271

> Rust is kind of nice in that it lets you choose between type erasure and monomorphization, or between heap-allocation and stack-allocation, but the downside is that you have to choose.

– Brook Heisler on discord

### 267

> In theory it would be entirely reasonable to guess that most Rust projects would need to use a significant amount of unsafe code to escape the limitations of the borrow checker. However, in practice it turns out (shockingly!) that the overwhelming majority of programs can be implemented perfectly well using only safe Rust.

### 165

> I really hate the phrase "fighting". Calling it a fight doesn't do justice to the conversations you have with the borrow checker when you use Rust every day. You don't fight with the borrow checker, because there isn't a fight to win. It's far more elegant, more precise. It's fencing; you fence with the borrow checker, with ripostes and parries and well-aimed thrusts. And sometimes, you get to the end and you realize you lose anyway because the thing you were trying to do was fundamentally wrong. And it's okay, because it's just fencing, and you're a little wiser, a little better-honed, a little more practiced for your next bout.
